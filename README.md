Week 2: Modify and Buiild a Web Application (in AWS)

For this assignment, you have been asked by your boss to roll out a new web application using an EC2 instance in AWS.  This instance will be running an updated web application that has been modified by you. You will need to download the helloworld.js and helloworld.conf files (located below).  Once downloaded, you will modify the helloworld.js file to display a different message other than "Hello World" when customers visit your website.  Like in our demo, you will need to create a security group that allows you to SSH into the machine and you will need to configure a specified port to allow access to your web server.    Below are all the requirements for this assignment.

**** Updated - please use the following link to upload the helloworld.conf file to your EC2 instance.  The helloworld.conf file below will not work properly when it is downloaded from your personal Github repository.
